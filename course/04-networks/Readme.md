# Understanding dimension of `networks`

## Summary
So far, we've successfully spinup a new instance and installed nginx on that.

## Networks
The dimension `networks` is required when you're trying to connect into different machines which are in different networks.

## Public network
If a network is exposed to internet and somebody from internet can be able to access the machine in the exposed network.

## Private network
Outside of this network can't be able to access the machine of this network.
