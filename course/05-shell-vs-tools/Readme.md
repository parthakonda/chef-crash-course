# Understanding shell vs tools

## Shell
- Manual
- You can't repeat the process
- You need to learn platform based shell
- Configuration needs to be manually maintained
- Errors


## Tools
- Automated
- You can repeat for n of machines
- You just need to learn its DSL (ansible, chef)
- Configuration will be maintained by server it self.
- Once it is done and verified then it will same in future (*)
